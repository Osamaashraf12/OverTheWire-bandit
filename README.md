# OverTheWire Bandit Writeups

## Introduction
This repository documents my solutions for the OverTheWire Bandit wargame, a beginner-friendly series teaching cybersecurity basics. As a penetration testing enthusiast, I’m using these writeups to strengthen my Linux and security skills. Each writeup covers my steps, key takeaways, and how the skills apply to real-world cybersecurity.

## About Bandit
Bandit is a wargame for absolute beginners, covering Linux commands, SSH, file manipulation, and scripting. The goal of each level is to find a secret key (often in a file or hidden elsewhere) to access the next level, starting from Level 0. Visit the OverTheWire website for level details and contact them with suggestions for improvements.<br/>
The OverTheWire Bandit wargame is perfect for beginners, teaching Linux and cybersecurity basics through hands-on challenges. Unlike traditional learning, Bandit’s interactive approach helps you develop essential skills like Linux navigation, SSH, scripting, and security concepts, preparing you for advanced wargames and real-world IT roles in an engaging and effective way.

You may encounter situations where you’re unsure what to do. Don’t panic! The goal is to learn by exploring new information. If stuck, my repository offers guidance.

## Getting Started
Start with Level 0 on the OverTheWire website. Follow the instructions there, then check my writeups below for detailed solutions.
